# Monty Hall Simulation

This program simulates the Monty Hall problem, a probability puzzle based on a TV game show.

## Description

The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle named after the host of the TV game show "Let's Make a Deal", Monty Hall. The problem is as follows:

1. There are three doors: behind one door, there is a car, and behind the other two doors, there are goats.
2. The player selects one door.
3. The host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining two doors, revealing a goat.
4. The player is then given the option to switch their choice to the other unopened door or stick with their initial choice.
5. The player makes their final decision.
6. The door the player chooses is then opened, and the player wins a car or a goat.

This program allows you to play the Monty Hall game by selecting a door, opening one door with a goat, and deciding whether to switch or not.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the door number you are selecting when prompted (1, 2, or 3).
3. The host will open one door that has a goat.
4. You will be asked if you want to switch doors.
5. Enter "yes" to switch or "no" to stick with your initial choice.
6. The program will reveal if you won the car or not.

## Example

- Enter the door number you are selecting (1, 2, or 3): 2  
- The host opened Door 3 which has a goat.  
- Do you want to switch doors? (yes/no): yes  
- Congratulations! You won the car!
